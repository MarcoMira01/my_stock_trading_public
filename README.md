This is an example project where I exploited the theory of stochastic diffusion processes estimation for the characterization of a trading asset in order to tun Montecarlo simulations and predictive control with MPC, resulting then in a Stochastic MPC (or SMPC).

Sorry for the lack of a readme with complete notes, but I ensure you will find a well commented code!
