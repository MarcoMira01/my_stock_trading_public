This is an example project where I exploited the theory of stochastic diffusion processes estimation for the characterization of a trading asset in order to tun Montecarlo simulations and predictive control with MPC, resulting then in a Stochastic MPC (or SMPC).

Also, the project contains an example of change point detection in a trading asset: the change point is defined as the point in time where statistical characteristics (mean and variace) vary (abruptly) and a new identification should be run.

Sorry for the lack of a readme with complete notes, but I ensure you will find a well commented code!
